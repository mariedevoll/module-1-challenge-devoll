# module-1-challenge-devoll
this is my mockup of making a web application more accessible and pleasing to the eye

Link to the deployed application: https://mariedevoll.github.io/module-1-challenge-devoll/

In this application, you will find that the links within the webpage function so when clicked, the page will scroll down to the appropriate section, which enhances the user's experience on the application.

You will also find that the application is accessible on multiple screen sizes and no images or text are skewed or distorted when the page is made larger or smaller.
